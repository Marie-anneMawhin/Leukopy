Classification of white blood cells.

## Context
The identification and classification of leukocytes, platelets and erythrocytes is crucial in the diagnosis of several hematological diseases, such as infectious diseases or regenerative anaemia.
A broader approach will aim at classifying other abnormal cells related to acute leukemia.

## Data

### Normal peripheral blood cells:
A publicly available [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/draft?a=d9582c71-9af0-4e59-9062-df30df05a121) of more than 17000 images of blood leukocytes from blood smears of healthy donors stained with MGG.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

8 types of white blood cells:
- neutrophils
- eosinophils
- basophils
- lymphocytes
- monocytes
- immature granulocytes (metemyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes)
- platelets
- erythroblasts
