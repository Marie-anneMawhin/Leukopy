    We are going to focus on the following cells:
    - neutrophils (segmented) - SNE
    - eosinophils - EO
    - basophils - BA
    - lymphocytes - LY
    - monocytes - MO
    - platelets - PLATELET
    - erythroblasts - ERB
    - immature (metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes) and band neutrophils - IG or separated - MMY, - MY, - PMY, and - BNE

    ## Data

    #### 1.PBC_dataset_normal_Barcelona

    A publicly available [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/draft?a=d9582c71-9af0-4e59-9062-df30df05a121) of more than 
    17000 images of blood leukocytes from blood smears of healthy donors stained with MGG.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
    
    #### 2.PBC_dataset_normal_Raabin
    A publicly available [dataset](https://raabindata.com/free-data/) around 15,000 images. 
    All samples are healthy except for a few basophils imaged from a leukaemia patient and come from three laboratories in Iran: 
    Razi Hospital in Rasht, Gholhak Laboratory, Shahr-e-Qods Laboratory and Takht-e Tavous Laboratory in Tehran.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>
    
    #### 3.PBS_dataset_AML_Munich
    A publicly available [dataset](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61080958). The data corresponds to 100 patients diagnosed 
    with Acute Myeloid Leukemia at Munich University Hospital between 2014 and 2017, as well as 100 patients without signs of haematological malignancy.<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>
